# 📖 Introduction

DeepFake technology uses AI to create synthetic videos that appear highly realistic. These manipulations can be difficult to detect with the human eye.

This project builds a **DeepFake detection pipeline** capable of identifying manipulated videos using deep neural networks and computer vision techniques.

---

# ⚠️ Motivation

DeepFake videos pose serious risks:

* 📰 Spread of misinformation
* 🎭 Identity impersonation
* 🔐 Security vulnerabilities
* 💻 Cyber fraud and scams

This project aims to address these challenges by building a reliable detection system.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

* Extract frames from video input
* Detect and crop faces from frames
* Use deep learning for feature extraction
* Classify frames as **Real or Fake**
* Aggregate predictions across frames
* Provide a simple **web interface** for users

# 🔄 Pre-processing Pipeline

1. Convert video into frames using OpenCV
2. Detect faces using MTCNN
3. Crop facial regions
4. Resize images to **128×128**
5. Normalize pixel values
6. Prepare tensors for model input

---

# 🔍 Prediction Pipeline

1. User uploads a video
2. Frames are extracted
3. Faces are detected and processed
4. Model predicts probability for each frame
5. Predictions are averaged
6. Final result is displayed

**Output Example:**

```
Prediction: Fake
Confidence: 0.94
```
